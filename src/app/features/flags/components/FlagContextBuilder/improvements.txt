- ContextInput component loses it's internal state is parent causes it to re-render.
- Same bug applies to AttributesSelection.


- ContextInput and AttributesSelection components should manage their own state and watch what they are looking for.

I want to do achieve this with a technical requirement:
 
ContextA's change in attributes shouldn't make ContextB's AttributesSelection component re-render. 
Same thing applies to the ContextInput component.

I've realised we are not really doing the container pattern properly at all. 
AttributesSelection is really acting as it's own container and then screwing itself over (same for ContextInput)
