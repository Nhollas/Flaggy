- ContextInput component loses it's internal state is parent causes it to re-render.
- Same bug applies to AttributesSelection.

- Container pattern is shite and should only be used for display components.


- ContextInput and AttributesSelection components should manage their own state and watch what they are looking for.

I want to do achieve this with a technical requirement:
 
ContextA's change in attributes shouldn't make ContextB's AttributesSelection component re-render. 
Same thing applies to the ContextInput component.
